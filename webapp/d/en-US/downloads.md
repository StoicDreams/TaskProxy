```

```quote "warning"
Please note this project is very early in development. We are currently focusing on prototyping feature development so expect a severe lack of polish.

Eventually as we flesh out the features and finalize our Phase-1 concepts we will start shifting focus over to polishing the user experience and squashing performance bottlenecks.

And while we have our own specific ideas on what user experiences we expect Task Proxy to have, we are an Agile development company and believe heavily in adapting to better ideas as we find them, so feel free to send your ideas and feedback to us using our Feedback tool in the header.

## Pricing

```section
We are not ready to fully detail our pricing structure for Task Proxy services. But we would like to note that the usage of the desktop app is planned to always be free to download and use, even once fully released.

We do plan on offering optional paid Cloud subscription services that will extend the features of Task Proxy at a later date.

In the meantime, if you would like to help support us, you are welcome to send us a contribution through our [GitHub Sponsors Page](https://github.com/sponsors/StoicDreams).
